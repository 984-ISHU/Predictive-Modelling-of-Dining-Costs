# Datathon

## Overview

In this datathon, we had access to a dataset containing information about various restaurants located in Bengaluru, collected from the popular restaurant and food delivery platform, Zomato. The primary task was to create a predictive model that estimates the cost associated with dining at these restaurants. Zomato defines this cost as the average expense required for two people to have a meal at a particular restaurant.

## Challenge

The challenge revolved around developing an accurate predictive model that could estimate the dining cost for two individuals based on various features provided in the dataset. These features included the restaurant's location, its rating, and potentially other relevant factors that might influence dining expenses.

## Objectives

Our main objectives for this datathon were:

1. **Data Exploration**: To gain a deep understanding of the dataset, including data cleaning, visualization, and summary statistics.

2. **Feature Engineering**: To create meaningful features from the dataset that can be used to build a predictive model.

3. **Model Development**: To use machine learning and statistical techniques to create a predictive model that estimates the dining cost accurately.

4. **Model Evaluation**: To evaluate the model's performance and fine-tune it for better predictions.

5. **Presentation and Documentation**: To communicate the findings and model in a clear and understandable manner.

## Dataset

The dataset provided included information on restaurants, such as their name, location, rating, type of cuisine, cost for two, and more. Understanding and manipulating this data was crucial in building an effective predictive model.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Data manipulation and analysis libraries (e.g., Pandas, NumPy)
- Data visualization libraries (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Machine learning libraries (e.g., Scikit-Learn, XGBoost)

## Results

Our team successfully developed a predictive model that could estimate the dining cost for two individuals at restaurants in Bengaluru with a good degree of accuracy. This model could be valuable for Zomato and its users, as it helps diners plan their dining experiences and make informed choices based on expected expenses.

## Acknowledgments

We would like to thank the organizers of the datathon for providing the opportunity to work on this interesting problem and learn more about data science and predictive modeling.
